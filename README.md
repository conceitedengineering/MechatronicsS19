# MechatronicsS19
<H1>HandCrank Week 1 </H1>
Making something that is simple and hand powered was the first project for Mechatronics. I enjoyed the challenge / freedom of not thinking about motors or complex control and figuring out a simple movement first. While the scope and time for this project was limited, I also wanted to use this opportunity to iterate on an older idea of a Lego kit of my own moving parts. The newer improvement being an attempt to copy the design of the mechanisms found on http://507movements.com/.
The outcome was surprisingly fast and robust. This method of observing a mechanism found online or elsewhere and attempting to convert to a cad file while seemingly simplistic but in the end worked with little time and fuss. For the future I would like to understand the simulation capabilities of Fusion360 a lot better than I do now. This would effectively eliminate my current temp of cardboard iteration, possibly saving lots of time and material wasted. For now I am quite happy with this process and intend on using it for project to come.

<H2>Method</H2>
I start out with a screenshot that I closely try and copy in fusion.
I then take the measurements from the copy and trudgen’s and even them out in a replica drawing.
Laser cut the test files in cardboard and use a pegboard system to identify the optimal position of the various parts.
Assemble, test and iterate.
Cut final parts, test with regular nuts first then move to locknut and grease to wrap up.

<H2>Tools needed</H2>
Adobe Fusion360(mostly free)
Access to Laser cutter
Nuts and Bolt of any size so long as your drawings reflect the right size.

# HandCrank Week 2
Mostly just moving from early prototype cardboard and MDF to finished black plexiglass .

# Mechanical Contraption Week 4

For this project I wanted to continue my seemingly neat approach to conceiving of and making complex moving parts. However I quickly found myself in a familiar place of asking, but why?
After a few days of pure contemplation and zero actions I suddenly came across the writings of Yuk Hui and found myself staring at a number of logs scattered by CCA. 
In his critique of Kant’s reductionist view of nature Hui elaborates on a Kantian view of nature and in essence the foundations of his Cosmopolitics.

>Consider Kant’s example of the tree from §64 of the Critique of Judgment. First, the tree reproduces itself according to its genus, meaning that it reproduces another tree. Second, the tree produces itself as an individual; it absorbs energy from the environment and turns it into nutrients that sustain its life. Third, different parts of the tree establish reciprocal relations with one another and thus constitute the whole.

He then Capps of with an incredible lesson about Dao & Chinese metaphysics

> What I love is Dao, which is much more splendid than my skill. When I first began to carve a bullock, I saw nothing but the whole bullock. Three years later, I no longer saw the bullock as a whole but in parts. Now I work on it by intuition and do not look at it with my eyes. My visual organs stop functioning while my intuition goes its own way. In accordance with the principle of heaven (nature), I cleave along the main seams and thrust the knife into the big cavities. Following the natural structure of the bullock, I never touch veins or tendons, much less the big bones!

I do not do the whole reading any justice and meerly pull out two striking quotes that had fuled this project. [Read the full thing!](https://www.e-flux.com/journal/86/161887/cosmotechnics-as-cosmopolitics/) Its free and awesome. Some familiarity with Kant and Hegel would pay off, otherwise ok!

## Method
For this project I resorted to my old ways of scraping together whatever I find to make thing move and work. 
Surprise surprise! this was a completely unworkable approach and I doubled down on the nonsense the more it failed. It took till the very end for me to learn my lesson and clean up my act. For instance ditching the first DC motor plus tire approach for a more predictable stepper motor and linkage. In the end I learned the value of strategic planing and design even though the artist within me is dying to staple-gun a bunch of shit together and pray it works.
