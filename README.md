# MechatronicsS19
<H1>HandCrank Week 1 </H1>
Making something that is simple and hand powered was the first project for Mechatronics. I enjoyed the challenge / freedom of not thinking about motors or complex control and figuring out a simple movement first. While the scope and time for this project was limited, I also wanted to use this opportunity to iterate on an older idea of a Lego kit of my own moving parts. The newer improvement being an attempt to copy the design of the mechanisms found on http://507movements.com/.
The outcome was surprisingly fast and robust. This method of observing a mechanism found online or elsewhere and attempting to convert to a cad file while seemingly simplistic but in the end worked with little time and fuss. For the future I would like to understand the simulation capabilities of Fusion360 a lot better than I do now. This would effectively eliminate my current temp of cardboard iteration, possibly saving lots of time and material wasted. For now I am quite happy with this process and intend on using it for project to come.

<H2>Method</H2>
I start out with a screenshot that I closely try and copy in fusion.
I then take the measurements from the copy and trudgen’s and even them out in a replica drawing.
Laser cut the test files in cardboard and use a pegboard system to identify the optimal position of the various parts.
Assemble, test and iterate.
Cut final parts, test with regular nuts first then move to locknut and grease to wrap up.

<H2>Tools needed</H2>
Adobe Fusion360(mostly free)
Access to Laser cutter
Nuts and Bolt of any size so long as your drawings reflect the right size.
